### Introduction

This library provides a suite of UI components designed specifically for Vue. Both ready-to-use and customizable, these components are developed as part of a thesis project and are ideal for development and experimental environments, though they may not yet be suitable for production use.

### Components

This library features five key components: modal, menu, select, multiselect, and accordion. For detailed documentation, code examples, and live demos, please visit the [documentation site](https://x-ui-components-vue.netlify.app/).

### Installation

To integrate these components into your Vue project, use the following command to install:

```bash
npm install x-ui-components-vue
```

Then, import the styles in your main JavaScript file:

```bash
import "x-ui-components-vue/dist/x-ui-components-vue.es.css";
```
