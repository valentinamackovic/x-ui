### Introduction

This library provides a suite of UI components designed specifically for Svelte. Both ready-to-use and customizable, these components are developed as part of a thesis project and are ideal for development and experimental environments, though they may not yet be suitable for production use.

### Components

This library features five key components: modal, menu, select, multiselect, and accordion. For detailed documentation, code examples, and live demos, please visit the [documentation site](tbd).

### Installation

To integrate these components into your Svelte project, use the following command to install:

```bash
npm install x-ui-components-svelte
```
